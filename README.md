# S2UID-Phase1
Here, I have created a portfolio which gives brief information about me.Here I made use of media queries to make the pages more responsive(mainly in 3ranges of width->0px-480px,480px-768px and 768px above).Have also included few animations to make it more interactive using hover,keyframes,etc.Then I tried to give all relative units(mainly "%") , it is bit more responsive.Then if I had to point a speciality in my portfolio - I used a background image and I feel my "about" page is bit unique too.I even tried to use opacity here,by making my box a bit transparent.
Css which are repeatedly used arre in "mock.css" ,then used internal css for which need to be applied for that page only.
